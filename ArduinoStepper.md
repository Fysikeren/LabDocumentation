# Arduino and stepper motor

I have an Arduino UNO and a CNC shield, along with a (single) stepper motor.
The plan is to have the stepper motor turn the coil bobbin, and count turns that way.

## Software and set-up

I installed the Arduino IDE from the [web page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) (cf. the warning at the top of [this page](http://playground.arduino.cc/Learning/Linux)) and use [Arduino CNC Shield Instructions](http://www.zyltech.com/arduino-cnc-shield-instructions/) as a guide for setting up the motor controllers.

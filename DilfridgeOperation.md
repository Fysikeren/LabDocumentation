# Operating the dilution refrigerator

## Using the cold trap

## Mounting the DR insert

## Cooling from a room temperature

If the magnet cryostat is a room temperature when the DR is inserted, you may simply start the magnet cooling while pumping on the helium system.
When the magnet reaches 4 K, the DR mixing chamber will reach about 400 mK, and the still about 1.7 K.

## Cooling to dilution temperatures

## Settings for 20 mK

In the DR/magnet logbook, Lise writes on May 20th 2016:

MC temperature has now been stable for 5 days at settings

P¹_dump = P²_dump = 120 mbar

I_still = 8.0 mA

T_still = 895 mK

P_still = 1.7·10⁻¹ mbar

P₅ ≈ 660 mbar

Flow = 43

T_MC = 25 mK

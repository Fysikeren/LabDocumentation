# Preparing a sample

## Casting the sample

The sample is placed inside one of the secondary coils, with the the size restrictions that entails.
The inner diameter of the secondaries is 2.2 mm, and the length of one coil is around the same.
The sample may be cast in epoxy/Stycast, along with copper wiring for thermal contact to the mixing chamber of the dilution fridge.
This wiring must be made from a number of very thin wires, electrically insulated from each other, to minimize eddy currents and thereby ensure that the susceptometer signal is disturbed as little as possible.
I plan to use the same magnet wire as for the primary coil.

On 2018-04-27 Ivica sent me a short description of how they cast samples in epoxy, and on 2018-04-30 Ursula sent me a "cookbook" for casting a powder sample in a PTFE/Teflon mould.

The cookbook goes as follows (edited to include Ivica's description):

  * After grinding, the sample powder is weighed in a plastic weighing dish.
  Ursula used around 40 mg of sample material.
  * Epoxy is mixed in a separate dish.
  * A bit of epoxy (of the same mass as the sample?) is transferred to the sample dish with a pipette, and the materials are mixed with a toothpick.
  This is weighed.
  * The mould is closed with PTFE tape at one end, with some ordinary sticky tape on top.
  * As much as possible of the sample/epoxy mixture is transferred to the mould, and the rest is weighed, to ensure you know how much is in the mould.
  * Now, four thin copper wires (200 Âµm) are placed in the sample, for use in thermal contact.
  * The sample is baked for 30 minutes or cured for 24 hours at room temperature.
  * The PTFE tape is removed, and the sample is forced out of the mould using a small hex key.
  * We are now ready to place the sample in the coil, and connect the copper wire to the cold head/the mixing chamber.

Ivica describes how a sample may also be cut to fit the mould, "in a desired way so that it does not move inside the hole".
This is for whole crystal samples, where the orientation is important.
Ivica suggests using a small carbon fibre tube as support if the sample is too small to fit nicely in the mould.
